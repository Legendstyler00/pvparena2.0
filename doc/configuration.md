# Configuration file

PVP Arena provides two kind of configuration files:
* Arena configuration files, to edit game settings for each arena. They are stored in `/arenas` directory.
* A global config file (like for any plugin), stored as `config.yml` at the root of plugin directory.

## Arena configuration files

The following block explains what are each parameter of arena config file. 
Most of those parameters can be changed via in-game command ([/pa set](commands/set.md)). Other ones can be changed with
dedicated commands (like regions, spawns or arena classes).

If you edit an arena configuration file, you can load changes with [`/pa <arena> reload`](commands/reload.md) command.

> ℹ This is an example configuration file.
