## Config settings

- hard \- the mod will restore EVERY block of your battle region, regardless of a known changed state (default: false)

- restoreblocks \- restore blocks (default: true)
- restorecontainers \- restore containers (chests, furnaces, brewing stands, etc) content (default: false) 
- restoreinteractions \- restore player interactions with blocks like opened doors or toggled levers (default: false) 
- containerlist \- list of coordinates of all registered containers 

## Commands

- `/pa [arena] !br hard` \- toggle the hard setting
- `/pa [arena] !br restoreblocks` \- toggle the restoreblocks setting
- `/pa [arena] !br restorecontainers` \- toggle the restorecontainers setting
- `/pa [arena] !br restoreinteractions` \- toggle the restoreinteractions setting
- `/pa [arena] !br addinv` \- add a new saved container location (uses the container you're looking)

> **🚩 Tips:**  
> - There's no need to manually add containers location to config. By default, all containers of your BATTLE region will
>   be registered on the first startup.
> - If you physically add new chests to your map, don't forget to register them. Even manually with 
>   `/pa [arena] !br addinv`, or by forcing a new complete registration with `/pa [arena] !br clearinv`.
> - BlockRestore is designed for block destruction, chest and block usage only. If you need advanced restoring 
>   (especially entities), please prefer [WorldEdit](./worldedit.md) mod.

> ⚙ **Technical precisions:**  
> - BlockRestore is fully asynchronous and may take some time restore the battlefield (few seconds in most cases). 
    This one is not reachable during the process.
> - Chest restoring may lag on the first startup or after a `clearinv`, because it searches the BATTLE region(s) for 
>   chests and saves location of each of them.
> - Due to API limitations on servers that are **not based on PaperMC**, destruction of linked blocks (like wall torches
>   when the support block is broken) is limited to doors and non-solid blocks on the top of the support block, along 
>   with directional blocks on the other faces.
